In this folder there are two contents for appyling sentiement analysis. The python script should be opened within jupyter notebooks but can be accessed in other IDE's with small editing.

The Movie review excel file contains each movie review and is utlizied by the python scripts.

Running the script requires some previous librarys to be installed: Metaplotlib.pyplot, Pandas, NLTK, Textblob and Operator. After installation be sure to run each cell down onwards to allow for the algorithm to be developed properly.
